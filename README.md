## Example

> Acknowledgment:
>> The first picture is a photo of *Chen Li*, and he has authorized the usage of the photo.
>> The rest two are randomly found on Google, if you are the owner and feel offensed, please contact me. I will replace them ASAP.
>> The project is still under construction, some issues regarding data conversion are yet to be solved, which has affected the accuracy of the model. Most of the problems are due to the fact that *Chen Li* has just started learning of Swift few hours ago. Hopefully, these problems will be resolved soon.
